      <p class="purple">I am a student at Cal State Fullerton majoring in Computer Science. I was born in
        Orange and grew up in Irvine,California. Up through high school, I spent a lot
        of time swimming and playing water polo all over Southern California, but ironically,
        I'm not a beach person. I actually enjoy spending my time indoors on my laptop.</p>

      <p class="blue">Since the coronavirus pandemic, my interests outside of schoolwork have been:
        reading manga, watching anime, and watching music videos. Normally, besides those
        things, I like to work out at the gym and go see movies and sing karaoke with
        friends.</p>
